Podunk Intesection

  NW  |  NE
------------
  SW  |  SE

1) Assume that the residents of Podunk are exceptional and follow the old (and widely ignored) convention that whoever arrives at the intersection first proceeds first. Using the language of synchronization primitives describe the way this intersection is controlled. In what ways is this method suboptimal?

> we make use of the rule who ever comes first gets to proceed first, this method is suboptimal because only one car will be able to use the intersection at a time even if there are available resources which other cars could take advantage of, for example if a car turns left from south going to west it will need SE, NE, NW but SW is still free, in this suboptimal apprach all the resources are not being properly utilized. 



2) Now, assume that the residents of Podunk are like most people and do not follow the convention described above. In what one instance can this four-way-stop intersection produce a deadlock? (It will be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to visualize an actual intersection).

> in the worst case scenario four cars come to the intersection from different directions and every car want to turn left then car from south will lock SE, car from east will lock NE, car from north will lock NW, and car from west will lock SW but all these cars need two more regions so they will be waiting for the other regions to be released thus creating a four way stop or a traffic jam or in out case a deadlock.
